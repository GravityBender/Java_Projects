# Animated Line Chart JavaFX

This is a project demonstrating an animated line chart made using Java and JavaFX.

## Features:

- If the file is not present, the program waits untill the file is created and data is entered in the file
- Line Chart produced develops sequentially with animation

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders, where:

- `resources`: stores the text file whose data has to be displayed in a line chart
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

## Requirements
In order to run this application you must have the latest version of Java installed(JDK11 at least) and JavaFX jar files imported.
